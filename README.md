### University of Washington Grades Dataset

By working with the `shiny` and `plotly` libraries we were able to create a responsive web application that analyzes the dataset of course grades from 2010-2016.

For our final project in INFO 201, we chose for analysis a dataset of class information for each class taught at the University of Washington (Seattle) from Autumn 2010 to Winter 2016. Specifically, we were most interested in the breakdown of the letter grading within each class. This data is anonymized and can be manipulated to highlight features that are important to current UW students. Using this data and our visualizations, the user can determine which classes have a higher average GPA when stratified by quarter.
